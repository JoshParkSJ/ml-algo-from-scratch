# ml-algo-from-scratch

ML algorithms implemented from scratch in Julia!

- KNN, K-means, K-medians clustering using squared distances and elbow plots to choose K
- linear, nonlinear, and robust regression by minimizing least squares and hubber loss
- logistic regression and multi-class logistic regression (softmax) with L0, L1, L2 regularization
- PCA using SVD to compute principal components and NMF by adding non-negativity to PCA
- Stochastic Gradient Descent and kernel methods such as polynomial and Gaussian-RBF kernel
